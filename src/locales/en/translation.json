At the moment, these are mainly small companies and shops next door, which are struggling with massive drops in sales and even forced closures. That's why our goal is to help small businesses next door (our 'favourite shops') by quickly providing them with financial resources - from the very people who depend on them. Because without the cafés, pubs, small shops and other businesses, our communities, towns and neighbourhoods would no longer be what they are. So together we can overcome the current crisis and jobs will be preserved."
